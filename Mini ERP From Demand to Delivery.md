## Fd **The Business Problem** 

## Meet “Shiv Furniture Works” 

Shiv Furniture is a growing furniture manufacturing company. 

Initially, they managed operations using: 

- Excel sheets 

- WhatsApp messages 

- Manual stock registers 

- Paper-based manufacturing notes 

As customer demand increased, problems started appearing: 

## Sales Team Problems 

- Sales team sold products without checking stock. 

- Customers received delayed deliveries. 

- No visibility on available inventory. 

## Purchase Team Problems 

- Purchase managers didn’t know when raw materials were running low. 

- Vendors received urgent last-minute purchase requests. 

## Manufacturing Team Problems 

- Operators didn’t know what to manufacture next. 

- BoMs were maintained on paper. 

- Work orders were not tracked. 

## Inventory Problems 

- No accurate stock balance. 

- Components consumed manually. 

- Finished goods not updated correctly. 

## Management Problems 

Owners had no visibility into: 

- Pending orders 

- Production delays 

- Material shortages 

- Manufacturing efficiency 

## **The Goal** 

Build a centralized Mini ERP system that allows Shiv Furniture to: 

- Manage products and inventory 

- Process sales and purchase operations 

- Manufacture products using BoMs 

- Track stock movement automatically 

- Trigger procurement automatically 

- Support Make To Stock (MTS) 

- Support Make To Order (MTO) 

- Maintain audit logs for traceability 

## **Core ERP Concept** 

The entire ERP revolves around one thing: **Inventory Movement** 

Every module affects stock: 

|**Module**|**Impact**|
|---|---|
|Sales|Decreases stock|
|Purchase|Increases stock|
|Manufacturing Components|Consumes stock|
|Manufacturing Finished Goods|Produces stock|
|Procurement|Replenishes stock|



## **Core Modules** 

The ERP consists of 5 major modules: 

1. Products 

2. Sales 

3. Purchase 

4. Manufacturing 

5. Bill of Materials (BoM) 

Additional: 

1. Audit Logs 

2. User Access Rights 

## **Target Users** 

|**User Type**|**Responsibility**|
|---|---|
|Admin|Full system access|
|Sales User|Manage sales orders|
|Purchase User|Manage purchase orders|
|Manufacturing User|Handle manufacturing orders|
|Inventory Manager|Track stock movement|
|Business Owner|Monitor business flow (manages<br>product)|



## **Authentication & Access Rights** 

Each module should support role-based access: 

|**Access Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Admin|Full access|
|User|Limited module access|
|None|No access|



Example: 

- Sales Users may only access Sales. 

- Manufacturing Users may only access Manufacturing. 

- Admin can access everything including Audit Logs. 

## **Core Business Flow** 

## **Step 1 – Product Creation** 

Products are created with: 

- Sales Price 

- Cost Price 

- Stock Quantity 

- Procurement Strategy 

Example: 

- Wooden Table 

- Office Chair 

- Dining Table 

## **Step 2 – Procurement Strategy** 

Every product can use either: 

## **MTS – Make To Stock** 

OR 

## **MTO – Make To Order** 

## **Understanding MTS   (Make To Stock)** 

Products are manufactured or purchased BEFORE customer demand. 

Example: Make To Stock Current Stock: 

- Wooden Chair = 100 Units 

- Customer orders: 

   - 10 Wooden Chairs 

Result 

The system delivers directly from stock. 

No procurement needed. 

## **Understanding MTO   (Make To Order)** 

Products are manufactured or purchased ONLY when a customer order arrives. 

Example: Make To Order 

Current Stock: 

- Wooden Table = 2 Units 

- Customer orders: 

- 10 Wooden Tables 

- Shortage: 

   - 8 Units 

System should automatically: 

## ● Create Purchase Order 

OR 

## ● Create Manufacturing Order 

depending on procurement configuration. 

## **Procurement Automation** 

Each product can be configured with 

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Procure on Demand|Enable automatic replenishment|
|Procurement Type|Purchase / Manufacturing|
|Vendor|Used for Purchase|
|BoM|Used for Manufacturing|



## **Example Procurement Flow** 

## **Scenario** 

Customer orders: 

- 20 Dining Tables 

- Available stock: 

● 5 

Shortage: 

- 15 

If Procurement Type = Manufacturing: System auto creates: 

● Manufacturing Order for 15 units If Procurement Type = Purchase: System auto creates: 

- Purchase Order for 15 units 

## **Product Module** 

Products act as the central inventory model. 

## **Features** 

- Product creation 

- Sales price 

- Cost price 

- On-hand quantity 

- Free-to-use quantity 

- Reserved quantity 

- Procurement setup 

- Stock visibility 

## **Inventory Concepts** 

## **On Hand Quantity** 

Actual physical stock. 

## **Reserved Quantity** 

Stock already committed to: 

- Sales Orders 

- Manufacturing Orders 

## **Free To Use Quantity** 

Available stock after reservations. 

Formula 

Free To Use Qty = On Hand Qty − Reserved Qty 

## **Sales Module** 

The Sales module manages customer demand. 

## **Features** 

- Create Sales Orders 

- Select customer 

- Add products 

- Check stock availability 

- Deliver products 

- Trigger procurement 

- Update inventory 

## 

Draft → Confirmed → Partially Delivered → Fully Delivered 

OR 

Draft → Cancelled 

## **Sales Business Logic** 

When Sales Order is confirmed: 

- Product availability is checked. 

- Quantity becomes reserved. 

- Procurement may trigger automatically. 

When delivered: 

- Stock decreases. 

**Purchase Module** 

The Purchase module replenishes stock. 

## **Features** 

- Create Purchase Orders 

- Vendor management 

- Receive products 

- Increase stock automatically 

## 

Draft → Confirmed → Partially Received → Fully Received 

## **Purchase Business Logic** 

When products are received: 

- On Hand Quantity increases. 

- Stock Ledger updates automatically. 

## **Manufacturing Module** 

Manufacturing converts raw materials into finished goods. 

## **Understanding Manufacturing** 

To manufacture products, businesses need: 

- Components 

- Operations 

- Work Centers 

- Work Orders 

- BoM 

## **Bill of Materials (BoM)** 

A BoM defines: 

- Components needed 

- Quantity needed 

- Operations required 

## **Example BoM** 

## **Product** 

Wooden Table 

## **Components** 

|**Component**|**Qty**|
|---|---|
|Wooden Legs|4|
|Wooden Top|1|
|Screws|12|



## **Operations** 

|**Operation**|**Duration**|
|---|---|
|Assembly|60 mins|
|Painting|30 mins|
|Packing|20 mins|



## **Manufacturing Order (MO)** 

An MO is created to manufacture products. 

## **MO Includes** 

- Finished Product 

- Quantity 

- Components 

- Work Orders 

- Assignee 

- BoM 

## **Work Orders** 

Work Orders are individual production steps. 

Example: 

- Assembly 

- Painting 

- Packing 

## **Work Centers** 

Physical locations where operations happen. 

Examples: 

- Assembly Line 

- Paint Floor 

- Packaging Unit 

## **Manufacturing Flow** 

## **Step 1** 

Create Manufacturing Order. 

## **Step 2** 

System fetches: 

- Components 

- Operations 

- Durations 

from BoM. 

## **Step 3** 

Components become reserved. 

## **Step 4** 

Operators execute Work Orders. 

## **Step 5** 

Finished goods added to stock. 

## **Step 6** 

Consumed components deducted from stock. 

## **Stock Ledger Concept** 

Stock Ledger tracks every inventory movement. 

## **Example – Manufacturing 10 Tables** 

## **Inventory Movement Summary** 

|**Product**|**Movement**|
|---|---|
|Legs|-40|
|Tops|-10|
|Screws|-120|
|Tables|+10|



## **Audit Logs** 

Every important change must be tracked. 

Examples: 

- Status changes 

- Quantity changes 

- Price updates 

- Deliveries 

- Manufacturing completion 

## **Dashboard Requirements** 

The ERP should provide a real-time dashboard with: 

- Total Sales Orders 

- Pending Deliveries 

- Manufacturing Orders 

- Delayed Orders 

- Total Purchase Orders 

- Partial Receipts 

## **Final Objective** 

Build a modular Mini ERP platform capable of: 

- Managing inventory 

- Processing sales & purchases 

- Manufacturing finished goods 

- Automating procurement 

- Supporting MTS & MTO flows 

- Maintaining stock traceability 

- Tracking audit logs 

- Providing operational visibility 

You're not just building an ERP—you are building the digital backbone of a growing business. Every order, purchase, manufacturing task, and inventory movement must work together as one connected system. 

The best solutions won't just manage data—they will orchestrate an entire business. 

Now it's your turn to make an IMPACT. 

Code smart. Build big. Have fun.
